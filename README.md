# Sleep-Quality Predictor
The Health and Sleep Statistics dataset provides a rich source of information about individualsâ€™ sleep habits and physical activity. However, it is necessary to explore this data to uncover patterns and correlations between these lifestyle factors and their potential impact on overall health. 

Main Base: A machine learning application that predicts sleep quality based on various lifestyle factors.
